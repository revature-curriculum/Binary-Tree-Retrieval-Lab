# Instructions:
In this lab you are given the `Node` class, a constructor of `Node(int x)`, and the method signature for your **Retrieval** method: `static Node SearchBT(Node temp, int key)`.

Write your logic in place of the `TODO` line in the `SearchBT()`'s body'. Do not forget to add a value to the given variable `key` in the main method. Your method should return a Node value that exists within the pre-constructed Binary Tree.
> This method should not create a new node. If the node does **not** exist the method should return `null`.

# Test
You are free to test your code using as many `System.out.print()` statements to test your outputs. You can also run our pre-built test cases by going to the *Checkmark* tab on the left side, and hitting `run tests`.
> Test cases will check the placement of a new node, and the relationship of the parent to the child node.
